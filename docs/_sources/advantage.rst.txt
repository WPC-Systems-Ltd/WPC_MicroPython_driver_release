Advantage of PYCO
=================

- PYCO separates the operating system, driver programs, and user applications, maintaining the cleanliness of the codebase.

- PYCO includes a ``FAT`` File System for storing Python code, data, and external libraries as files.

- PYCO allows the importation of external libraries, facilitating AI inference for tinyML applications.

- PYCO supports multi-threading and object-oriented programming (OOP).

- PYCO supports ``ulab`` library, similar to numpy, enables powerful mathematical computations.

- PYCO is suitable for ultra-low-power applications, making it ideal for battery environments without generating heat.

- PYCO can serve both ``remote control`` and ``stand-alone`` functionalities simultaneously.

- PYCO is a script language, eliminating the need for compilation before execution.
